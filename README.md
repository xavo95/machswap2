# machswap2

An iOS kernel exploit for iOS 11 - 12.1.2. Based on the task_swap_mach_voucher bug (CVE-2019-6225), joint-discovered/released by @S0rryMyBad and @bazad. Somewhat loosely based on @s1guza's v0rtex exploit, and @tihmstar's v3ntex exploit. 

Many thanks to @s1guza, @littlelailo, and @qwertyoruiopz.
